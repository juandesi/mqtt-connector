# On New Message 

Publishing a message doesnâ€™t make sense if no one ever receives it. In other words, if there are no clients to subscribe to the topics of the messages. To receive messages on topics of interest the client can Subscribe on the MQTT broker to the topics of interest. In the MQTT Connector the **On New Message** source, enables the capability to subscribe to any number of topics an trigger a flow execution for each new message received.
