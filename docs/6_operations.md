# Operations

MQTT is a **publish/subscribe** protocol that allows edge-of-network devices to send a message to a broker. Clients connect to this broker, which then mediates communication between the two or more devices. Each device can register to one or more topics.

In MQTT the process of sending messages is called **publishing**. On the other hand, an MQTT client must **subscribe** to an MQTT topic to receive messages.

This defines 2 operations: `PUBLISH` and `SUBSCRIBE`
